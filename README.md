# HeteroKGRep
The official code implementation for HeteroKGRep from our paper:
"Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph based Drug Repositioning" (Knowledge-Based Systems, 2024).

## Model description

HeteroKGRep is a drug repositioning framework that leverages heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graphs to discover novel drugâ€“disease associations.
Unlike existing methods based on homogeneous data sources, HeteroKGRep integrates multimodal biomedical information (ontologies, pathways, literature, genetic data) to enrich representation learning and improve prediction accuracy.
